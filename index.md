<p>I am currently a researcher at Microsoft GenAI. I obtained my Ph.D from University of California, Los Angeles, advised by Yizhou Sun and Wei Wang at Scalable Analytics Institute (ScAi), Department of Computer Science and UCLA Data Mining Lab. Before coming to UCLA, I graduated in 2017 from Department of Automation, School of Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University.</p>
